# hello_world
My first repository

Hello, I am an aspiring data analyst who wants to explore the possibilities that github offers.
I am mostly interested in learning how to put my data analysis projects on git and how to showcase my abilities.
Hope to learn a lot through seeing others' projects and creating my own.
This is a very exciting and new journey for me as I am not familiar with coding. 

Cheers!
